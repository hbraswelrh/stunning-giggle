## Course Layout

The ComplyTime module course leveraged the GitHub Actions automated capabilities. The course itself has two steps that are expanded upon as the course progresses.

To ensure the GitHub Actions automation will work properly, once the GitHub issue is opened in your copy of `creme-brulee` make sure that you write a comment on the issue. 

#### Example :speech_balloon:

##### Refresh page once you've made your copy of the `creme-brulee` repository.

##### Click "Go to Exercise." You'll be in the body of the GitHub issue that outlines _Step 1: Read the Docs_

Welcome to the ComplyTime learning course\! This guide will help you navigate the course, which is built on GitHub Skills and uses automated workflows to set up your personalized workspace. You'll use GitHub Issues to keep track of your notes as you progress.

### **Step 1: Dive into the `creme-brulee` Course Documentation**

The very first step in your ComplyTime journey is to thoroughly review the provided `creme-brulee` course documentation. These materials are essential for understanding the project and setting the stage for the rest of your learning.

#### **Mandatory Review Materials**

Make sure you read through all the documents listed below. They are foundational to your success in this course:

#### **Taking Notes**

As you go through the documentation, it's highly recommended that you take detailed notes. Your personal workspace, created by the automated workflows, allows you to use GitHub Issues for this purpose.

* To document your notes, create a new GitHub Issue.  
* **Important:** When creating your issue, make sure to select the "**Learning course issue template**." This will help you keep your notes organized and consistent.  
* You can refer to [this example](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for guidance on how to create an issue.

### **Step 2: Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've confidently reviewed all the documentation and taken your notes, it's time to test your understanding.

* Complete the short [self-assessment](https://form.typeform.com/to/tiOAik8G). This will help solidify your knowledge and prepare you for the next stages of the course.

Good luck with your ComplyTime learning journey\!
