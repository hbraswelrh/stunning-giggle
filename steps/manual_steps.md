#### **Taking Notes**

As you go through the documentation, it's highly recommended that you take detailed notes. Your personal workspace, created by the automated workflows, allows you to use GitHub Issues for this purpose.

* To document your notes, create a new GitHub Issue.  
* **Important:** When creating your issue, make sure to select the "**Learning course issue template**." This will help you keep your notes organized and consistent.  
* You can refer to [this example](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for guidance on how to create an issue.

### **Step 2: Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've confidently reviewed all the documentation and taken your notes, it's time to test your understanding.

* Complete the short [self-assessment](https://form.typeform.com/to/tiOAik8G). This will help solidify your knowledge and prepare you for the next stages of the course.

Good luck with your ComplyTime learning journey\!

### **📝 Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've thoroughly reviewed all the documentation above, take this short [self-assessment quiz](https://form.typeform.com/to/tiOAik8G). Good luck\! 🚀


## Step 2: Initialize the oscal-content-demo with complyscribe

_This will house the authored OSCAL content_

### 📖 Theory: Author OSCAL Content and Update it in your [oscal-content-demo](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/oscal-content-demo/tree/main)

The [oscal-content-demo](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/trestle-workspace/tree/main) is a public repository template that can be leveraged with complyscribe in GitHub CI. The file structure layout is seen in the tree below. 

### ⌨️ Activity: Interact with the oscal-content-demo

To interact with the oscal-content-demo, you will need to create your own copy. This public repository template [oscal-content-demo](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/trestle-workspace/tree/main) allows you to create unlimited copies, providing a safe and secure sandbox for testing the tools directly.

**Step 1🖱️:** Navigate to the [oscal-content-demo](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/oscal-content-demo/tree/main). Click the green box in the upper right corner that says "Use this template."

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f0d54c1-daef-488a-b8e4-0887cf7e491a" alt="text" width="375" height="200">

**Step 2🖱️🟩:** Click "Create a new repository." This step is comparable to the "Make a Copy" functionality when duplicating a Google Doc. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce8f4a7-453d-408e-8174-75cec1cc507a" alt="text" width="250" height="85">

**Step 3🖱️🟩:** Ensure that you are the repository owner and create a name for your new oscal-content-demo template. Then, click "Create Repository."

_You can choose to make the repository Public or Private_

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4ffe1a-20f0-4ab7-abd7-d76a2eb10573" alt="text" width="250" height="250">

**Step 4🪄:** Your repository has now been created and will be available under `{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/{OSCAL_CONTENT_DEMO_NAME}`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7fd13d0-4e58-4613-851c-57bb09f5b7f2" alt="text" width="375" height="200">

### Getting Comfortable with the `oscal-content-demo` flow

Follow the steps on the [oscal-content-demo](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/oscal-content-demo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) `README.md`for making your first change.

### `oscal-content-demo` Context: 

#### Running `complyscribe` commands in GitHub Actions 

The oscal-content-demo supports running `complyscribe` commands in GitHub Actions. The available actions are `autosync`, `create-cd`, and `rules-transform`. The workflows can be found [here](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/oscal-content-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md). This is a simplistic way to get started with your first few tests.

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your oscal-content-demo workspace.

<img alt="img.png" height="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/4b8054ba9e94bd83b14d991cebda3d575d2420dd/docs/images/img.png" width="400"/>

2. Click "Run workflow."

This will prompt for your input depending on the command being run. If authoring Component Definitions, the input fields will populate for indicating profile, component title, component description, etc. Those are manual inputs. Autosync will run based on the trigger of "Run workflow."

<img alt="img_2.png" height="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/4b8054ba9e94bd83b14d991cebda3d575d2420dd/docs/images/img_2.png" width="150"/>

<img alt="img_6.png" height="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/4b8054ba9e94bd83b14d991cebda3d575d2420dd/docs/images/img_6.png" width="150"/>

<img alt="img_3.png" height="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/4b8054ba9e94bd83b14d991cebda3d575d2420dd/docs/images/img_3.png" width="160"/>
   
3. Make sure the `branch: main` is indicated, and then click the green box "Run Workflow."

<img alt="img_4.png" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/4b8054ba9e94bd83b14d991cebda3d575d2420dd/docs/images/img_4.png" width="250"/>

#### Self-assessment

_Let's see what you've learned_

Take the [self-assessment](https://form.typeform.com/to/EwVRNkJ4) once you have completed Step 2: _Initializing oscal-content-demo with complyscribe_.

##### What You'll Submit

Once completing Step 2: _Initializing oscal-content-demo with complyscribe_, you will have made changes on the `develop` branch of your `oscal-content-demo` repository. 

The changes made will be reflected in your Pull Request. Copy and paste the link of your Pull Request in the self-assessment. 

> Example: "ComplyTime Learning Course: {YOUR_NAME}."

#### Reviewing generated OSCAL Content from ComplianceAsCode/content

The oscal-content-demo supports running `complyscribe` commands in GitHub Actions. The `sync-cac-content` command that generates OSCAL Catalogs, Profiles, and Component Definitions is not currently available as a GitHub Action. The RHEL8, RHEL9, and RHEL10 product OSCAL Catalogs, Profiles, and Component Definitions are available in your workspace. The content from `ComplianceAsCode/content` was used with the `complyscribe sync-cac-content` commands to populate this content. The `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` repository is ongoing development and will synchronize the `ComplianceAsCode/content` resources with the `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` repository to continuously sync changes.  

#### Example using ANSSI

You want to create an OSCAL Catalog, OSCAL Profile, and an OSCAL Component Definition for a RHEL9 CIS Benchmark. The [ComplianceAsCode/content](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) repository houses up-to-date security content that is leveraged for transformation to OSCAL Content. 

Starting with the OSCAL Catalog, you want to base it off of the CIS Benchmark for RHEL9. Let `complyscribe` do the magic 🪄 in GitHub Actions.

See the Miro board here for a breakdown of the connectivity of `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content` and `ComplianceAsCode/content` with `complyscribe`.

#### Annotated File Tree 📂

The annotated file tree can be referenced in [annotated-tree.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/95c4bbb99cbb0e0b28b459f19950983ca13d34b7/docs/annotated-tree.md) which shows the current state of the oscal-content-demo public template. The annotations are consistent with the table below. 

- The `annotated-tree.md` indicates "Control File `cis_rhel9` from ComplianceAsCode/content" and "RHEL9 Profile for cis_rhel9-l1_x/12_x." Reference the second column of the table for how the elements of the ComplianceAsCode/content repository align with the trestle-workspace content.

- The base file tree without annotations can be found in [workspace-tree.md](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/520790e4c8b261cfe2b83a804c1c2728bdacb3ef/docs/workspace-tree.md)
