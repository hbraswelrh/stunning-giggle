1. Learn about the relevant repositories in the ComplyTime organization.
2. Understand the relationship of the repositories and how the oscal-content-demo workspace mirrors the oscal-content repository. More info [here](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/e2574a94f9ac3f85a35d29749d326969d0faafbe/steps/manual_steps.md)
3. Trigger GitHub Actions that allow you to author OSCAL content. 
4. Practice using Git, Markdown, and ComplyTime tools.
